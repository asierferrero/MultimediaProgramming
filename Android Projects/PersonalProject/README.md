## Personal Project

### For this project, I have made an Android application related with Basque football teams. 

To first use the app, you have to log into the app. (Default user: admin, password: Admin123).

When entered, you will first see the home menu where you can add an store some Basque football teams. To add a new team, you only have to click on `Add` section that ia available in the bottom menu.

Once added, you can click on the star to add them to favorites, and they will be added to `Favorites` section that you can access from the bottom menu.

When clicking on any team, you can see their name, crest and description entered before and two different buttons; one for visiting that club's web, and the other one to see where their stadium is located.

### Other functionalities
When changing languages between english, basque and spanish in the mobile settings, the application will also change the language.

Moreover, the app can be visualized corrrectly in both dark and light mode.
